## Sprint Retrospective (4nd)

A brief analysis concerning issues faced during the fourth sprint of development.


Integration phase:

- The integration phase between Giacomo Zanotti and Nicola Giancecchi was a key point in order to implement what is called as "waiting room", which is a fundamental step to synchronize players before the starting the nearby game mode.


Bug fixing:

- The integration phase creates new bugs. Finding and fixing them requires quite a lot of time.

Testing:

- Testing Firebase, Actors and minor stuff was not easy at all. Here there is lack of experience which could have lead to save some time.
